# Universal Mach-O Proof-of-Concept Repo

VSCode [debug is currently broken][1] on macOS M1 machines (`aarch64` / `arm64`).
(As of 2021-01-25)

This repo is a simple proof-of-concept for how to get
VSCode to build & debug a simple Hello World program written in C.

## Disclaimer

This **should not** be seen as "Best Practices" in any way...
This is merely one example of how to work around the issues with using [`ms-vscode.cpptools`][2]
in its current state.

Please see the [macOS Developer Documentation][3] for Apple's recommended method(s).
